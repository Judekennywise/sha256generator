1. After you have downloaded the csv file. Save in your diretory where you easily access it. It might be in your 'C\:' directory.

2. Create a folder named "NFT" in your "C:\" directory where you will be saving the NFT json file for each row in your CSV. Take note of this path , as it will needed later.

3. To convert the CSV file(each line) into json files
open the makejsonfile.py

4. Run the file; it will prompt for your csv file path.

5. Make sure to copy the path where your CSV file is located. Example is C:\Mechanic Team boot_CSV.csv. make sure it has the '.csv' extention. in this case 'Mechanic Team boot_CSV.csv' is the file we want to open, while 'C:\' is the path.

6. Hit enter; it will also prompt for the path where you want to save the json files. Enter the path of the folder you created in step 2. example; C:\NFT

7. Hit enter and it prints the name of NFTs and also the generated SHA256 for each row. That tells you that json file has been created. Now check into the folder for the json files, You will find all json files for each row in CHIP-007 format.
